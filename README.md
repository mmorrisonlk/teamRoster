This assignment was a pain. There is a bit of html magic at work here. Technically the code works when deployed but good safety practices prevent me from testing the way I have the HTML set up locally. Because my solution involves dumping the user inputs into a seperate html file and then dynamically linking that to the main html. I also kind of worked forward backwards because I had knowledge of handlebars as I had learned over the last few weeks. I also don't know why Bulma format doesn't want to work for me exactly like I want it.
